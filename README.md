### Plan for Creating a Gameboy Emulator:

1. **Implement the CPU (Central Processing Unit):**
   - Start by implementing the CPU emulator. The Gameboy uses a custom processor (a variant of the Z80). Implement instructions based on the CPU’s opcode table and their respective timings.

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Implement memory mapping and management. The Gameboy has different memory regions for ROM, RAM, graphics, sound, and I/O registers. Ensure accurate memory access and timing.

3. **Graphics (PPU - Picture Processing Unit):**
   - Emulate the PPU to render graphics. Understand how tiles, sprites, and backgrounds are managed and displayed on the screen. Implement pixel rendering and screen drawing routines.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - Implement input handling for buttons (directional pad and action buttons). Simulate button presses and releases based on user input.

5. **Sound Emulation:**
   - Emulate the Gameboy’s sound hardware, including square waves, wave table sounds, noise generation, and volume envelopes. Implement sound output routines.

6. **Timer and Interrupt Handling:**
   - Implement the timer system that generates interrupts at regular intervals. Handle interrupts and their respective interrupt service routines (ISRs).

7. **Cartridge (ROM) Handling:**
    - Implement cartridge loading and management. Understand different cartridge types (e.g., MBC1, MBC3) and how they affect memory banking and access.

8. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Test your emulator with a variety of Gameboy ROMs (games and test ROMs). Use debugging tools to trace execution, inspect memory, and verify CPU and PPU behavior.

9. **Optimization and Performance:**
    - Optimize your emulator for performance, especially in critical sections like CPU instruction execution and graphics rendering.

10. **Documentation and Refactoring:**
    - Document your code thoroughly, especially the emulator’s architecture and how different components interact.
    - Refactor and optimize your codebase based on feedback and performance profiling.

11. **Optional Enhancements:**
    - Implement save state functionality.
    - Add debugging features like memory viewers, breakpoints, and step-through execution.
